# Transformers


## Project Description

The project aims to provide an easy-to-use implementation of the DETR (DEtection TRansformers) model for object detection and segmentation. DETR is a transformer-based model that has shown promising results in these computer vision tasks.

## Files

- `detr.py`: This file contains the main implementation of the DETR model, including the transformer architecture for object detection.
- `backbone.py`: Implements the backbone network used in the DETR model.
- `matcher.py`: Provides the matching mechanism used to associate objects in the query and target sets.
- `position_encoding.py`: Contains the positional encoding mechanism used in the transformer.
- `segmentation.py`: Implements the segmentation head of the DETR model.
- `transformer.py`: Defines the core transformer blocks used in the model.


## Usage

To use the DETR model for object detection and segmentation, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the model with your desired configuration.
2. Load pre-trained weights if available.
3. Provide input images for inference.
4. Run the model for object detection and segmentation.

Here's an example Python script that demonstrates the basic usage:

```python
from detr import DETR

# Initialize the model
model = DETR()

# Load pre-trained weights (optional)
model.load_weights('pretrained_weights.pth')

# Load an image
image = load_image('input.jpg')

# Perform object detection and segmentation
results = model.detect_and_segment(image)

# Save the results
save_results(results, 'output.jpg')
```
